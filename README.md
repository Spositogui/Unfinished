RULES

Before commiting something, please ask all members of the group if all agree if the changes !
Remember, DON'T EDIT THE SAME LINE OF THE SAME ARCHIVE AT THE SAME TIME, thanks !
If you are just here to see the project progression, don't copy our content, everything is copyrighted (it's a lie, but you understand me)
For the members of the group, remember, for all new releases don't forget to put the right version of the project
Don't know if we need more rules, so if you have an ideia of one, please comment :D
